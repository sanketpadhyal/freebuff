// Where bash lives on a Windows machine. Every surface that needs a shell — the SDK's
// run_terminal_command, the Desktop terminal panel, the Desktop's per-workspace startup script —
// asks this module, so they can never disagree about whether this machine has bash.
//
// Agents are overwhelmingly trained on bash, so bash is what we run: PowerShell is a different
// language the model does not write well, and a POSIX command translated on the fly is a command
// that fails in a new way. Git for Windows ships a real bash, so "does this machine have bash" is
// in practice "did Git for Windows land anywhere we know to look".
//
// Looking in enough places is the whole job. An install that we fail to find is indistinguishable
// to the user from no install at all: they run the installer, we keep saying bash is missing, and
// the only conclusion available to them is that the app is broken.
