/**
 * Classification of completion-stream endings that would otherwise silently
 * end the turn with nothing visible to the user. Two classes:
 *
 * **'stream-interrupted'** — the connection was cut mid-response. A healthy
 * OpenAI-compatible SSE stream always ends with a chunk carrying a real
 * `finish_reason` (and, on our backend, usage totals) before `[DONE]`. When
 * the connection dies mid-stream — a server deploy killing the instance, a
 * proxy timeout, a network drop — the HTTP body just ends: the AI SDK
 * provider's flush then emits a `finish` part with raw finish reason
 * `'unknown'` and no usage (normalized to `'other'` by AI SDK 7), and the
 * stream otherwise looks like a normal completion. `'unknown'` alone is not
 * proof: providers map any unrecognized `finish_reason` string to `'unknown'`
 * too. Usage disambiguates — it arrives in the stream's final chunk, so
 * `'unknown'` *with* usage means an odd but complete stream, while `'unknown'`
 * *without* usage means the tail was never received. A missing finish part
 * altogether is always an interruption.
 *
 * **'output-limit'** — the model produced no text or tool calls because it
 * either spent its output budget on reasoning (`length`) or ended the stream
 * after emitting only native reasoning, under any finish reason the provider
 * chose to report (a Bedrock-via-OpenRouter reasoning-only end has arrived as
 * 'unknown' with usage). Both are complete, well-formed streams whose turns
 * would otherwise end with nothing visible. A `length` stop after real output
 * is the answer running long, which is not silently recoverable (retrying
 * would duplicate output).
 *
 * Before this existed, both classes read as the agent "randomly stopping"
 * mid-thinking with no error anywhere (2026-07-17 incident).
