/**
 * Nothing we ship may be mistaken for a third-party client.
 *
 * The downgrade now runs unconditionally with no flag to disable it, so a
 * freebuff agent the detector flags is served a different model in production
 * with no way to switch it off short of a revert and redeploy. This has already
 * happened twice, both silently:
 *
 *  - `researcher-web` offers `['web_search', 'read_url']` and was flagged on
 *    100% of its 334,042 requests from 4,821 users over 30 days.
 *  - `freebuff-desktop-autorun` offers only the custom tool `decide`, so it had
 *    no signature tool at all — 2,904 requests from 41 users.
 *
 * Both were found by querying production, which is the wrong place to find
 * them. This scans the source instead, so the next one fails CI.
 *
 * Reading source with a regex is crude, and the real hazard is that it quietly
 * stops matching and the test passes on an empty set — hence the floor below
 * and the named spot checks.
