/**
 * Browser-like user agent passed to ad providers for targeting and fraud
 * screening. Keep this shared by every native client so one surface cannot
 * accidentally fall back to a runtime UA such as `Bun/<version>`.
 *
 * Gravity is explicit that the user agent drives "device-type classification
 * and bot filtering" (https://docs.trygravity.ai/ai-platforms/tracking-proxy),
 * which makes a stale version an active liability rather than cosmetic debt:
 * a browser two years out of date is itself a bot fingerprint.
 *
 * This sat at `124.0.0.0` — Chrome's April 2024 release — until 2026-08-18,
 * roughly 27 stable versions behind, while the comment claimed a recent bump.
 * The comment was tracking when someone edited the file, not what the constant
 * said. Compare the number against the current stable Chrome, not the date
 * below.
 *
 * Last bumped: 2026-08-18 (Chrome 151, then current stable). Revisit roughly
 * every six months.
