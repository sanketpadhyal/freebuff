/**
 * Shared SQL + threshold logic for the production database health alerts
 * (docs/db-capacity-and-scaling.md §7 rec #3 and #4).
 *
 * The queries are plain SQL strings (not drizzle fragments) so this module
 * stays dependency-free; the alert scripts wrap them with `sql.raw(...)`.
 * Threshold defaults are grounded in the capacity doc's measured numbers:
 *
 *   - Wraparound: the doc measured `xid_age` 199.6M = 9.98% of the 2^31 budget
 *     and called it "not urgent". DEFAULT_WRAPAROUND_PCT (50%) pages with
 *     roughly a year of runway at today's growth, and is the standard
 *     conservative wraparound bar.
 *   - backend_xmin: the 2026-08-03 incident's long-lived snapshots were
 *     1,137,687 transactions behind (normal is ~1); DEFAULT_BACKEND_XMIN_XID
 *     (1M) sits just under that severity while far above any ordinary backend.
 *   - Invalid index: the incident's `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` was stuck for
 *     72 minutes; DEFAULT_STUCK_BUILD_MINUTES (30) is far above any normal
 *     build while catching a stuck one.
 *   - Busy-backend equivalents: the incident query held 9.65 backends (59% of
 *     all DB execution); current total fleet load is ~4.0 (§5.5).
 *     DEFAULT_BUSY_BACKENDS (4) pages when ONE query owns as much as the
 *     entire fleet currently uses.
 *
 * PRIVILEGES ARE A COVERAGE DIAL, NOT A PRECONDITION. These alerts previously
 * refused to run without `pg_read_all_stats` and were dark for a month as a
 * result. See `evaluateStatCoverage` for what each role can actually read and
 * why the grant is not obtainable from application credentials.

/**
 * One pg_stat_statements snapshot for the current database.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF ROW, AND THE SECOND IS THE WHOLE POINT. Without
 * `pg_read_all_stats`, `queryid` is redacted **in lockstep with `query`** — not
 * just the text. Measured on production 2026-08-19 as `manicode_app`: of 4,694
 * rows, 3,854 had redacted text and *exactly those* 3,854 had a NULL `queryid`,
 * with zero exceptions. An earlier version of this query filtered
 * `WHERE queryid IS NOT NULL`, which therefore dropped every other role's
 * statements — leaving the rank able to see **0.98% of execution time** while
 * still answering "no single query reached N busy-backend equivalents". That is
 * precisely the silent all-clear this watchdog exists to prevent.
 *
 * What survives redaction is the part that matters: `userid`, `calls` and
 * `total_exec_time` are all readable. So the unreadable rows are folded into
 * one bucket per owning role, keyed `opaque:<userid>` so the key is stable
 * across the two snapshots and the delta still works. The bucket cannot name a
 * query, but it answers the question the alert is really asking — is something
 * this role cannot see consuming the database?
 *
 * Buckets are safe to rank alongside real queries because the metric is a
 * DELTA: on production the two opaque buckets held 1,089,687 cumulative
 * exec-seconds and yet moved 0.000 busy-backend equivalents over a 30s window,
 * because that total is frozen history from a previous app role. They surface
 * when something is actually running, not merely because they are large.

 * false, on the stated premise that "pg_stat_statements shows only the role's
 * OWN statements". **That premise is wrong**, and it kept both monitors dark
 * for a month while the grant sat unprovisioned. Measured against production
 * on 2026-08-18 without the grant:
 *
 *   as manicode_scripts   3,403 pgss rows visible, 1,333 with text
 *   as manicode_user      3,410 pgss rows visible, 2,010 with text (94.5% of
 *                         all execution time), 183 of 197 backends readable
 *
 * pg_stat_statements exposes every row to every role; only the `query` TEXT of
 * another role's statements is replaced with `<insufficient privilege>`. Since
 * the busy-backend rank is computed from `total_exec_time` deltas, it is exact
 * without the grant — only attribution is degraded. `pg_stat_activity` is the
 * genuinely restricted one, and there the app role sees every app backend.
 *
 * So the grant is a nice-to-have, not a precondition, and BROKEN is reserved
 * for the states where the numbers really are uncomputable: no statement rows
 * at all (extension missing or wrong database) or no readable backend.
 *
 * The grant itself is NOT obtainable with our credentials — verified on
 * production: `GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO manicode_scripts` fails with
 * "Only roles with the ADMIN option on role pg_read_all_stats may grant this
 * role", and neither `manicode_user` nor `manicode_scripts` holds it
 * (`pg_monitor` is granted only to Render's `datadog` role). Closing the
 * remaining gap needs a Render support request, so nothing here may depend on
 * it.
