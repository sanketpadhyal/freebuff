/**
 * UTC day-string helpers shared by the rollup jobs and the dashboards that

 * These used to be copied into each consumer (scripts/rollup-ad-revenue.ts,
 * scripts/rollup-freebuff-spend.ts, web/src/db/ad-revenue.ts and
 * freebuff/web/src/lib/admin-spend.ts each carried a `shiftUtcDay`). The
 * window-boundary math is the sensitive part — a half-open `[start, end)` bound
 * or a trailing-window off-by-one silently drops or double-counts a day — so it
 * now lives here, in one place, instead of four copies that could drift.
 *
 * All helpers are pure string/Date math and return YYYY-MM-DD or ISO strings.
