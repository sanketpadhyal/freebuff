/**
 * Who gets shown the onboarding form.
 *
 * Nothing here is a permission check. Onboarding never refuses a request on any
 * surface — the entire mechanism is one redirect, to a form with a Skip button,
 * fired at most once per browser. What this decides is who is interrupted.
 *
 * The answer is: **anyone who has not answered, once.** New signups get it on
 * their way in; a long-standing account gets it the next time they sign in
 * through the web portal. There is deliberately no cutover date any more. One
 * existed when the form was a blocking gate, to keep existing users from being
 * locked out of a product they already used — with nothing to lock them out of,
 * a cutover only means never learning anything about the 200,000 accounts we
 * already have. The Skip button and the seen-cookie are what protect them now,
 * and they cost a single dismissible screen instead of an exemption.
 *
 * The polarity is deliberate: **an unset or `off` switch shows it to NOBODY.**
 * Absence of config disables the feature rather than enabling it universally.
 * This repo has already paid for the opposite convention once — a deleted env
 * var silently activating a default is documented in
 * db-capacity-and-scaling.md §10.6 — and here that mistake would present as
 * every user meeting a form nobody decided to launch.
