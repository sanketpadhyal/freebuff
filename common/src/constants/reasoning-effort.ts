/**
 * The one reasoning-effort vocabulary, shared by every surface.
 *
 * This list started in `freebuff-desktop/src/shared/types.ts`, where it drives
 * the Claude Code and Codex effort pickers. It lives here now so the Freebuff
 * model catalog and Desktop speak the same words: Desktop re-exports these,
 * so a value persisted on a Desktop thread and a value on a Freebuff catalog
 * row are the same strings, comparable without a translation table.
 *
 * ORDERED, ascending, and that order is load-bearing — `clampReasoningEffort`
 * does index arithmetic on it to answer "the most effort this model allows,
 * but no more than was asked for". Keep it strictly ascending.
 *
 * Not every rung reaches every provider. `ultra` exists only for local CLI
 * harnesses; Meta tops out at `xhigh`, while both DeepSeek V4 models expose
 * `low`/`high`/`max` and nothing between. What a given model actually offers is
 * its own `efforts` array, and the clamp stops one model's rung reaching
 * another's API.

 * `high` should land on `high` — the closest thing to what they asked for —
