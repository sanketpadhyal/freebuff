/**
 * Freebuff Levels — the earned half of the free-capacity story.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, next to `freebuff-trust.ts`
 *
 * `freebuff-trust.ts` ("Access Level") answers *how much do we believe this
 * account is a person*. It is a scorer over durable facts an account cannot
 * fake, it moves on the order of days, and nothing a user does on purpose
 * moves it quickly. That is exactly right for an abuse control and exactly
 * wrong for an incentive.
 *
 * This file is the other half: **Trust**, a spendable, earnable currency, and
 * the **Level** it buys. It moves in seconds, it is denominated in something a
 * user can go and do right now (engage with a promoted post), and it is
 * *supposed* to be gamed — that is what an incentive is.
 *
 * The two multiply the same way the region tier and the access level do:
 *
 * ```
 * sessions = accessLevelBase(tier, accessLevel)   // can this account be trusted
 *          + levelBonus(level)                    // what has this account earned
 *          + referral + streak + operator grants  // untouched
 * ```
 *
 * A Level never *subtracts* — it only ever adds to the base an Access Level
 * selected. That invariant is the same one `freebuff-trust.ts` documents, and
 * it exists for the same reason: two systems that can each take capacity away
 * produce a user who cannot be told why they have less than yesterday.
 *
 * ## The base moved a LITTLE at the same time
 *
 * Premium went 5 → 4 and the limited-region pool 6 → 3 in the same change that
 * added this file. Two rules shaped those numbers, and they pull against each
 * other:
 *
 *   - A ladder bolted onto a floor that already gives you everything is
 *     decoration. There has to be something above the floor to climb toward.
 *   - A floor that COLLAPSES is a regression every existing user feels on the
 *     same afternoon, and no amount of "you can earn it back" reads as
 *     anything other than a takeaway. An earlier draft dropped both bases to
 *     1; this comment exists to warn against putting that back.
 *
 * So: one session off premium, and a real cut only where the pool is genuinely
 * being drained (see `FREEBUFF_LIMITED_SESSION_LIMIT`). Everything above that
 * is earned, and the ceiling is HIGHER than any base ever was — 7 on both
 * pools, against bases of 4 and 3.
 *
 * ## Both halves move together, or not at all
 *
 * `FREEBUFF_LEVEL_SESSIONS=off` reverts the reduced bases AND suppresses the
 * bonus, as one lever. A reduced base with the ladder switched off is a pure
 * takeaway — the one configuration this feature must never be able to land in
 * — so the switch deliberately cannot express it.
 *
 * ## Full-access standard models are not on this ladder at all
 *
 * They are not metered at all, on any surface — the browser-only standard pool
 * was removed in the same week (see the note on `FREEBUFF_STANDARD_MODEL_IDS`).
 * That is the floor of the product, the thing we mean when we say Freebuff is
 * free, and putting it on a ladder would make Levels read as a paywall on the
 * base product rather than as a way up from it. Levels only ever touch the two
 * pools that are genuinely scarce.
 *
 * ## Everything here is a dial, and it will be turned
 *
 * The rates below are the opening position of an economy, not a constant like
 * a timezone. They are expected to move — weekly at first — as we learn what
 * an engagement is really worth and how fast people climb. So:
 *
 *   - every number lives in ONE table (`FREEBUFF_LEVELS`) rather than being
 *     spread across the call sites that consume it;
 *   - nothing is derived from a formula that would have to be reverse-engineered
 *     before it could be adjusted;
 *   - the thresholds are CUMULATIVE totals, not per-level deltas, so a user's
 *     stored balance keeps its meaning when the table changes underneath it.
 *     Re-tuning a delta silently re-levels everybody; re-tuning a threshold
 *     re-levels only the people who cross it.
 *
 * The last point is the load-bearing one. `trust_points` in the database is a
 * running balance and never a level, and the level is recomputed from the
 * balance on every read (`levelForTrust`). There is no migration to write when
 * a threshold moves.

/**
 * The table. Eleven rungs from a base of 3 free / 4 premium to a ceiling of 7
 * on both.
 *
 * ## How the numbers were picked
 *
 * One engagement is one real like + comment + repost on someone else's post,
 * proven with a screenshot. That is a couple of minutes of genuine attention,
 * and we sell it for $0.50 — so the ladder has to be worth a couple of minutes
 * and cannot be worth so much that buying the engagement is cheaper than
 * buying the compute.
 *
 * At level 0 an engagement pays 50 and level 1 costs 100: **two engagements to
 * the first rung**, which is the number that decides whether anybody starts.
 * From there the engagements-per-level count drifts from 3 up to about 9 at
 * the top, so the ladder gets meaningfully harder without ever crossing into
 * the range where a user does the arithmetic and stops.
 *
 * ## Sessions arrive on alternating rungs, and stop at 7
 *
 * A session is a chunky reward — one is a visible fraction of a day's capacity
 * — so the two columns step up on alternating levels rather than every level.
 * That keeps every rung worth something without inflating the ceiling, and it
 * leaves seven meaningful steps between the base and the top.
 *
 * Level 0 is exactly the reduced base (3 limited / 4 premium), which is what
 * makes `levelSessionBonus` a pure delta. Four engagements — two levels — put
 * a limited-region account back above where it started, and the ceiling on
 * both pools is above every base this product has ever had.
 *
 * The top rungs grant no further sessions and are deliberately not dead:
 * `trustPerEngagement` keeps climbing (200 at Architect, four times the base),
 * so a high-level account rebuilds its balance far faster against the
 * per-prompt drain — which is what actually keeps a heavy user at the ceiling
 * rather than sliding off it.

 * What one prompt costs, by how expensive the model behind it is.
 *
 * ## Why a prompt and not a request
 *
 * Charged once per *root run* (`isNewPromptWindow`), exactly like
 * `userMessagesPerDay`. An agentic turn that fans out into fifty subagent
 * calls costs one prompt's Trust, because charging per LLM request would price
 * "use the agent properly" at ten times "ask it a question" and teach people
 * to avoid the product's best feature.
 *
 * ## Standard prompts are free, and the rest are cheap
 *
 * The first version charged 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 and allowed a balance to run to
 * -500. Measured a few days in: **17,993 of 18,013 accounts held a negative
 * balance**, the median was -102, 2,125 were pinned at the floor, and 48 —
 * forty-eight — had ever earned anything at all.
 *
 * So it was not a slow tide. It was a meter that only ran one way, and what a
 * user saw was a "Trust score" of -75 next to their name. People read that as
 * an abuse finding and wrote in asking which fraud signal had flagged them,
 * which is the worst possible reading of a currency meant to reward them.
 *
 * Two things were wrong. The rates were too high for how much people actually
 * send, and earning barely worked — the engagement feed was serving nothing,
 * so the only reachable direction was down.
 *
 * A message now costs 1, whatever it was sent to. Flat.
 *
 * The tiering was the part that made the number unpredictable: the same
 * afternoon's work cost wildly different amounts depending on which model
 * happened to be selected, and nobody could form an expectation of how fast
 * their score moved. One is a rate a person can reason about — an engagement
 * pays 50, so it covers 50 messages — and it is the smallest debit that keeps
 * the mechanic real at all.
 *
 * ## A balance never goes below zero
 *
 * Zero is the floor. A user with no Trust still sends messages — they simply
 * hold no level, and their sessions fall back to the base. Refusing a message
 * for want of Trust would turn a gamification currency into an accidental
 * paywall, and the paywall we actually want is the subscription: priced,
 * disclosed, and not denominated in points.
