/**
 * The two provider dimensions the spend dashboard slices by, and why there are
 * two rather than one.
 *
 * A model id names its VENDOR — `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`, `z-ai/glm-5.2`. It does
 * not name who sends us the bill. Luna is served through OpenRouter with our
 * own OpenAI key as the last backup (#1767); GLM 5.2 is served by CrofAI; every
 * DeepSeek id runs a cascade across CrofAI, RunInfra, Infron and DeepSeek
 * direct. So on a page about money, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` filed under
 * "Google" is not a rounding error — it credits a company we have no contract
 * with and hides the one we actually pay.
 *
 * Hence:
 *
 *   - {@link modelVendor} — parsed from the id. Always available, including for
 *     rows written before any of this existed. Answers "whose model is this".
 *   - `message.provider` — stamped by the lane that computed the cost, so it is
 *     the billing counterparty by construction rather than by inference.
 *     Answers "who charged us for it". NULL for rows written before the column
 *     shipped; those render as {@link UNATTRIBUTED_PROVIDER} and age out of the
 *     rollup on its own retention window.
 *
 * There is deliberately no model -> provider guess for the NULL rows. The ids
 * whose vendor and biller differ are exactly the ids carrying most of the
 * spend, so a guess would be wrong precisely where it is read.
 *
 * This file is in `common/`, which is published wholesale to the public repo
 * (docs/freebuff-honeypot-models.md). That is fine here: these are the names of
 * companies we buy inference from, all of them already named in
 * ./provider-routes.ts. Do not add prices, ceilings, or routing preference to
 * this file.
 */

/**
 * Billing counterparties — who invoices us, not who trained the model.
 *
 * One id per lane in `web/src/llm-api/`, because a lane is the unit that holds
 * a credential and computes a cost. `getChatCompletionsProvider` in
 * chat/completions/_post.ts picks the ENTRY lane from these; a cascade can move
 * a request to a different one, which is the whole reason the served lane is
 * recorded per message instead of derived.
